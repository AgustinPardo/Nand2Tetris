### Chapter 11: Compiler II - Code generation
The compilation of high-level programming language into a low-level one focuses on 2 main issues: ***data translation*** and ***command translation***
#### 11.1 Data translation
Programs manipulate many variables. For variables we need to care about some of its attributes: *type* (integer, boolean, array, object) and and *scope* (object field, local, argument, global).

#### 11.2 Command translation

### Chapter 12: Operating system
